## Go To Statement Considered Harmful

"The go to statement as it stands is just too primitive; it is too much an invitation to make a mess of one's program. One can regard and appreciate the clauses considered as bridling its use. I do not claim that the clauses mentioned are exhaustive in the sense that/hey will satisfy all needs, but whatever clauses are suggested (e.g. abortion clauses) they should satisfy the requirement that a programmer independent coordinate system can be maintained to describe the process in a helpful and manageable way."

"Mr. Mooers believes that "well-drawn standards are not enough to prevent irresponsible deviation in computer languages""

"Mooers' policy, which applies in academic institutions as well as commercial users, includes "authorized use of the algorithm and primitives of a specific TRAC language; authorization for experimentation with the language..." I think that this attempt to protect a language and its software by controlling the name is very ill-advised."

"I believe that this doctrine of autonomous standardization and trademark identification is a long step forward in service to the user public, and thus is in the right direction. According to the almost uniformly favorable response we have received to date, many others seem to think the same way. I expect to see the doctrine have wide application." - ####Mr. Mooer's reply

#### Things I learned from this paper thus far:
TRAC (Text Reckoning And Compiling) is a programming language developed by Calvin Mooers that is purely text based and has strong emphasis on strings.
