### [1] When does a physical system compute? (incomplete) 
This paper explains when a physical system computes and goes in depth on how abstract and physical entities go in conjunction by using the "representation relation" and/or generally physics. In terms of representation relation, the paper states: "...it is how physics works. This relation is how we can write down |ψ and think that we are talking about an electron or a hydrogen atom or a Bose–Einstein condensate. Every time we use something abstract to represent something physical, we use a representation relation". 

### [2] Experimental Investigations of the Utility of Detailed Flowcharts in Programming:
In this paper, Ben Shneiderman, Richard Mayer, Don McKay and Peter Heller have set up a total of five deliberate experiments in order to determine the advantages and disadvantages of using flowcharts in improving programming composition, comprehension, debugging and modification, as well as finalising and discussing the results. The experiments were conducted with the use of "subjects", basically meaning various groups of university students. As a result of this, the paper ultimately concluded two things; detailed flowcharts are superfluous presentations of the information contained in programming language statements, as mentioned in the following quote: "We conjecture that detailed flowcharts are merely a redundant presentation of the information contained in the programming language statements. The flowcharts may even be at a disadvantage because they are not as complete (omitting declarations, statement labels, and input/output formats) and require many more pages than do the concise programming language statements." Lastly, it was also concluded that the experiments did not provide the utility and benefits of detailed flowcharts in program composition, comprehension, debugging or modification, resulting in further work needing to be done in order to analyse and understand other areas where flowcharts may be useful. 

### Quotes:

"She feels the flowchart is "an essential tool in problem solving" and states, "The person who cannot flowchart cannot anticipate a problem, analyze the problem, plan the solution, or solve the problem.""
- A bold statement, and I don't feel like this is necessarily true. While flowcharts do provide clear paths and visualisation, I don't believe they are as vital as mentioned. Especially when it comes to programming, one can't always expect and predict problems that arise based on flowcharts alone. 

### [3] A Fast Procedure for Computing the Distance Between Complex Objects in Three-Dimensional Space (incomplete)


### Quotes
"It applies to a complex family of shape models and is particularly convenient when the objects are subject to changes in position and orientation."
- This appears to be a practical application for video games, among others. 

### [4] Letters to the Editor: Go To Statement Considered Harmful

This paper contained a considerable number of letters to an editor where programming related discussions were tackled. Various programming ideas and approaches were discussed and opinionated. One of the first letters in the paper was written by Edsger W. Dijkstra, where he stated his displeasure on the go to statement and how it should be abolished from all "higher level" programming languages -- except, perhaps, plain machine code. Regarding Dijkstra's major issue with the go to statement - if I understood it correctly -, I believe he was stressing the difficulty of "finding a meaningful set of coordinates in which to describe the process progress", meaning that determining the state of the process would be proven difficult.

### Quotes
"The go to statement as it stands is just too primitive; it is too much an invitation to make a mess of one's program. One can regard and appreciate the clauses considered as bridling its use. I do not claim that the clauses mentioned are exhaustive in the sense that/hey will satisfy all needs, but whatever clauses are suggested (e.g. abortion clauses) they should satisfy the requirement that a programmer independent coordinate system can be maintained to describe the process in a helpful and manageable way."

"Mooers' policy, which applies in academic institutions as well as commercial users, includes "authorized use of the algorithm and primitives of a specific TRAC language; authorization for experimentation with the language..." I think that this attempt to protect a language and its software by controlling the name is very ill-advised."

"I believe that this doctrine of autonomous standardization and trademark identification is a long step forward in service to the user public, and thus is in the right direction. According to the almost uniformly favorable response we have received to date, many others seem to think the same way. I expect to see the doctrine have wide application." - Mr. Mooer's reply
